        USMC also follows a no trace left mentallity when using any public areas which most outdoor boulder problems will
        be located in, as such we expect all members that will be using club gear to treat the areas where you boulder 
        with high amounts of respect. The following link will explain some basic outdoor bouldering concepts on how to help 
        maintain the condition of where ever you are climbing.
