        To borrow boulder equipment you will need to demonstrate that you are able to spot a climber 
        safely and that you have knowlage on where the best place to put boulder matts is on a boulder route. 
        The following links will explain these 2 concepts in more detail.

        USMC also follows a no trace left mentallity when using any public areas which most outdoor boulder problems will
        be located in, as such we expect all members that will be using club gear to treat the areas where you boulder 
        with high amounts of respect. The following link will explain some basic outdoor bouldering concepts on how to help 
        maintain the condition of where ever you are climbing.

        To borrow Sport climbing Gear you will need to show that you can tie the correct knots, put on a harness correctly
        and that you are able to belay another climber safely.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most important peices of information you need to know is how to tie the Trace-Eight (or Trace Figure-Eight Knot), this is the most commonly used knot
        in climbing and is the knot you use to tie into a harness before you climb.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      Being able to put on and tie into a harness correctly is another skill that is required in order to be able to climb safely, The club uses harnesses with 
      2 loops with a single one that goes between them which you will mostly be using and what the following video shows you how to tie into however 
      the club also has absailing harnesses which differ because they only have a horizontal single loop. The difference when setting up for a climb with this harness
      is simply that you rope when you are the climber will only go through one loop instead of 2, when belaying you will need to becarful as due to the horizontal 
      loop, it means that you belay will try to turn to the side so you will need to pay atention and try and keep the belay vertical to the best of your abillity.<br><br>

    </p>
    <p>
      Another important skill is belaying, The method that the BMC reccomends is in the Video bellow, some key points are that the teeth of the 
      belay device should be pointing downwards, the belay device should be put onto the single vertical loop on a harness, there is an image on the side of most belay devices that will show a climber, that climber should be
      pointing upwards. The bite of rope that you put into the belay device should go through the hole which corisponds to what hand you are i.e right hole if right handed and vice versa.
      the gate of the carabiner should be facing the oposite direction to what hand you are, ie left if your right handed, the smaller end of a carabiner should also 
      be towards your body. <br>

      Ettiquet is a big part of climbing, respecting and comunicating with your fellow climbers will lead to a better climbing expirence for all, 
      it is important when you are out climbing that you communicate and make sure everyone is on the same page AND is comfertable with what ever you are doing.
      Keeping the location where you are climbing clean aswell is an important part of being a rock climber and insures that others will be able to use the rocks.
      Common ettiquet for when your climbing is that if someone is climbing a route that crosses over yours, you should wait for them to finish before you climb,
      if someone is trying to get down from somewhere and they are above you, you should wait for them to get down as they might not feel safe decending if your in the way due to the risk of accidently 
      dropping something on you. The following video goes over more exmaples of climbing ettiquet that everyone should try to keep in mind when climbing. <br><br>
