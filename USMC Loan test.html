        USMC also follows a no trace left mentallity when using any public areas which most outdoor boulder problems will
        be located in, as such we expect all members that will be using club gear to treat the areas where you boulder 
        with high amounts of respect. The following link will explain some basic outdoor bouldering concepts on how to help 
        maintain the condition of where ever you are climbing.

        To borrow Sport climbing Gear you will need to show that you can tie the correct knots, put on a harness correctly
        and that you are able to belay another climber safely.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most important peices of information you need to know is how to tie the Trace-Eight (or Trace Figure-Eight Knot), this is the most commonly used knot
        in climbing and is the knot you use to tie into a harness before you climb.<br>
