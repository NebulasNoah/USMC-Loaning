        USMC allows for it's members to borrow certain pieces of gear. 
        You will be required to sign a liability 
        form and demonstrate a specified level of skill which varies between each piece of gear.
        This site will also act as a place where you can get information about each of the climbing skills.
        <br><br> There is a maximum duration that you will be allowed to 
        borrow gear for, which the club has fixed at 10 days, if gear is kept after this time you will be charged however
        this also means you can extend your borrow period for a fee.

        One of the most important peices of information you need to know is how to tie the Trace-Eight (or Trace Figure-Eight Knot), this is the most commonly used knot
        in climbing and is the knot you use to tie into a harness before you climb.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      Another knot that is important to know how to tie is a stopper knot. This is used when you want to prevent the rope from slipping through
      any peices equipment.<br><br>

    </p>
    <p>
      Being able to put on and tie into a harness correctly is another skill that is required in order to be able to climb safely, The club uses harnesses with 
      2 loops with a single one that goes between them which you will mostly be using and what the following video shows you how to tie into however 
      the club also has absailing harnesses which differ because they only have a horizontal single loop. The difference when setting up for a climb with this harness
      is simply that you rope when you are the climber will only go through one loop instead of 2, when belaying you will need to becarful as due to the horizontal 
      loop, it means that you belay will try to turn to the side so you will need to pay atention and try and keep the belay vertical to the best of your abillity.<br><br>

    </p>
    <p>
      Another important skill is belaying, The method that the BMC reccomends is in the Video bellow, some key points are that the teeth of the 
      belay device should be pointing downwards, the belay device should be put onto the single vertical loop on a harness, there is an image on the side of most belay devices that will show a climber, that climber should be
      pointing upwards. The bite of rope that you put into the belay device should go through the hole which corisponds to what hand you are i.e right hole if right handed and vice versa.
      the gate of the carabiner should be facing the oposite direction to what hand you are, ie left if your right handed, the smaller end of a carabiner should also 
      be towards your body. <br>

      Ettiquet is a big part of climbing, respecting and comunicating with your fellow climbers will lead to a better climbing expirence for all, 
      it is important when you are out climbing that you communicate and make sure everyone is on the same page AND is comfertable with what ever you are doing.
      Keeping the location where you are climbing clean aswell is an important part of being a rock climber and insures that others will be able to use the rocks.
      Common ettiquet for when your climbing is that if someone is climbing a route that crosses over yours, you should wait for them to finish before you climb,
      if someone is trying to get down from somewhere and they are above you, you should wait for them to get down as they might not feel safe decending if your in the way due to the risk of accidently 
      dropping something on you. The following video goes over more exmaples of climbing ettiquet that everyone should try to keep in mind when climbing. <br><br>

        <a href="PDF/sling.pdf"><button class="my-gear-button">Personal Anchor</button></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Sport climbing is any form of outdoor climbing where you are using bolts that have been drilled into and 
    attached to the rock. These provide an attachment for quickdraws so that you can lead climb outdoors by clipping your 
    rope into the quickdraws. The top of the route will then have an anchor (usually 2 bolts with a chain and a ring but this can vary) 
    to allow you to safely descend or go on to multi-pitch another route.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is crucial that you do not use the bolts/chains for anything other than their intended use since 
    pulling on them can cause finger injuries and stepping on them or attaching incorrect gear can damage 
    them. As a rule of thumb, metal gear should be attached to the bolts and the chain, whilst ropes should 
    be run through the ring.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Clipping quickdraws</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Quickdraws have two snap-gate carabiners at each end, which are differentiated since one carabiner can 
    slide and move whilst the other is fixed. If clipped to the bolt correctly, this ensures correct loading of the 
    bolt and quickdraw if you were to take a lead fall. It is also important to ensure correct quickdraw 
    clipping to reduce the chances of the rope unclipping itself if you were to lead fall.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clip correctly, the carabiner that moves (the wobbly end) should be attached to the bolt, 
    whilst your rope is clipped into the fixed carabiner. The easiest way to remember this is always think ‘wobbly to wall’. 
    To orientate the carabiner correctly, the gate should face away from the direction you are travelling. For example, if the next 
    bolt is to the left of the bolt you are clipping, the quickdraw gate should face to the right (and vice versa).<br><br>

  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Setting up top ropes/cleaning anchors</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you get to the top of a sport route, there will be an anchor and the way they look 
    can vary a lot. The most important rules to remember are:<br><br>
    •	You must maintain 2 points of contact at all times, meaning that you must be loaded on both bolts at all times. 
    To do this, we use a 
    personal anchor (sling + carabiner attached to your harness) and never fully untie the rope from ourselves.<br>
    •	Its also important to never completely untie yourself from the rope in case you drop it. We also recommend 
    trying to keep gear attached to something at all times to reduce the risks of it being dropped and lost.<br>
    •	Weight bearing gear should be placed at the back of everything, including behind the chain.<br>
    •	<b>NEVER</b> untie/detach anything that is taut and weight beating since this is likely to be what 
    is stopping you from falling. You should only ever untie/detach something if it is loose.<br>
    •	Screw-gate carabiners should always be screwed closed when in use with their gates screwed down. 
    This allows gravity to help prevent them from accidentally unscrewing upwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    The easiest type of anchor to use is when there are two level bolts with a chain connecting them and a ring in the middle.<br>
    <img class="center-anchor" src="images/kassie picture chain with loop.jpg" alt="Anchor with loop">
  </p>
  <p>
    To set up a top rope on this type of anchor:<br>
1.	Attach 1 quickdraw to a bolt, ensuring the gate faces outwards.<br>
2.	Clip your rope into the quickdraw.<br>
3.	Get your belayer to take and clip your personal sling to a bolt or the chain (if you are on a good ledge
 and feel comfortable to do so, you can omit this step).<br>
4.	Clip a 2nd quickdraw to the other bolt, ensuring the gate also faces outwards.<br>
5.	Clip yourself into the 2nd quickdraw, ensuring the rope runs smoothly through both quickdraws
 and the end of the rope attached to your harness comes out the front of the quickdraws. The two quickdraws should be 
 opposite and opposed and shown in the image below.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="center-anchor" src="images/kassie picture no chain.jpg" alt="Quickdraw anchor"><br>
      To clean this type of anchor:<br>
1.	Attach your personal sling to a bolt or the chain.<br>
2.	Ask for slack and pull the loose rope through the ring.<br>
3.	With the loose rope, create a bite and tie a double figure of eight knot.<br>
4.	Using a screw gate carabiner, clip the double figure of eight knot to your harness’ belay loop. Ensure the screw gate is closed.<br>
5.	Get your belayer to take.<br>
6.	Untie your original rope knot. This should be easily identifiable since it will be loose since it is no longer 
weight bearing and will be tied through both your harness loops rather than just your belay loop.<br>
7.	Pull the loose rope through the ring (you may need some slack to do this) and loosely attach it 
to your harness to prevent it getting caught.<br>
8.	Remove both quickdraws from the bolts.<br>
9.	Check you are weighted on the rope and detach your personal anchor.<br>
10.	Ensure no gear has been left behind before descending.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to be able to adapt these methods to the type of anchor you are using so ensure 
      you know what type of anchor the route has and that you have the necessary gear.<br><br>
For offset anchors where the bolts aren’t level, you can use slings to alter the lengths of
 quickdraws/carabiners to ensure they meet at the same point so that they’re loaded equally.<br>
 <img class="center-anchor" src="images/kassie picture off set.jpg" alt="off set anchor"><br>
 For anchors without a chain (there will be 2 bolts, each with a ring directly attached to them), 
 you must still ensure you have 2 points of contact so a rope would need to be run through both rings 
 instead of one. You also wouldn’t be able to clip your personal anchor into the chain or rings at any point so 
 would need to use the bolts instead.<br>

  <h2>
    Checking Gear
  </h2>
  <p>
    It is important when using any peice of gear to be able to check that the gear is in safe enough condition and while the club does 
    check all gear before lending it out, 
    mistakes can happen and lowering the chance of these mistakes happening by looking out for signs of damage is always usful.
